# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Data
Model to analyze bike-sharing patterns.

# Description
The goal for this project was to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I was able to have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before to move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
